# WORK PORTFOLIO
The following are some of the projects that I have been working on.

## 1. Netflix-movie-recommendation
Objectives: 1. Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated. 
2. Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE)

Constraints: Some form of interpretability.

## 2. Quora-question-pair-similarity
Problem Statement
    Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked.
    This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.
    We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.
Constraints:
    The cost of a mis-classification can be very high.
    You would want a probability of a pair of questions to be duplicates so that you can choose any threshold of choice.
    No strict latency concerns.
    Interpretability is partially important.
