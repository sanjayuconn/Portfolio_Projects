## ABOUT ME 
       Hi, I'm Sanjay, ML Engineer/Scientist passionate about solving business problems using AI/ML. 

## WORK PORTFOLIO
Below are some of the personal projects that I found interesting to work on:

## 1. Netflix-movie-recommendation
Objectives: 
1. Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated. 
2. Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE)

Constraints: Model should have some form of interpretability.

## 2. Quora-question-pair-similarity
Problem Statement:

    Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked.
    This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.
    We are tasked with predicting whether a pair of questions are duplicates or not.
    
Constraints:

    The cost of a mis-classification can be very high.
    You would want a probability of a pair of questions to be duplicates so that you can choose any threshold of choice.
    No strict latency concerns.
    Interpretability is partially important.

## 3. Facebook-Friend-Recommendation
Problem Statement:

    Given a directed social graph, have to predict missing links to recommend users (Link Prediction in graph).
    
Constraints:

    
    No low-latency requirement.
    Probability of prediction is useful to recommend highest probability links

## 4. UBER-Taxi-demand-prediction
Problem Statement:

    To find number of pickups, given location cordinates(latitude and longitude) and time, in the query region and surrounding regions.
    
Performance metrics:

    Mean Absolute percentage error.
    Mean Squared error.

## 5. Human-Activity-Recognition
Problem Statement:

    This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying.This dataset is collected from 30 persons(referred as subjects in this dataset), performing different activities with a smartphone to their waists. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (accelerometer and Gyroscope) in that smartphone. This experiment was video recorded to label the data manually.
    
Objectives:

    Given a new datapoint we have to predict the Activity

## 6. Stack Overflow: Tag Prediction
Problem Statement:

    Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming knowledge, and build their careers.
    Suggest the tags based on the content that was there in the question posted on Stackoverflow. 
    
Objectives:

    
    Predict as many tags as possible with high precision and recall.
    Incorrect tags could impact customer experience on StackOverflow.
    No strict latency constraints.
